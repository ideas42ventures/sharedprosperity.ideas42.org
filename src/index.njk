    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <div class="font-size-3">
      <p>
        Shared Prosperity Catalyst will apply a behavioral lens to all that we 
        view as financial health, and expand that view to include the physical and 
        mental health impacts of experiencing poverty. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Driven by an experienced team of behavioral designers, policy experts, and 
        business builders and powered by a diverse network of academics, 
        practitioners, and entrepreneurs with experience in the communities we aim 
        to serve, this multi-year initiative will focus on creating more equitable 
        prosperity across the United States. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Achieving this will require three parallel efforts, each informed by a 
        deep understanding of behavioral science.
