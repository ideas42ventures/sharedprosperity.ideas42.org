    <p class="hero__body">
      Human beings are processing enormous amounts of information at any one time, 
      and invariably, can’t make sense of all of it. To get by, we use heuristics 
      (e.g., rule of thumbs) and narratives.
    </p>
  </header>
  <p>
    Narrative can be defined as ”a collection or system of related stories that 
    are articulated and refined over time to represent a central idea or belief.” 
    Narratives come from innumerable sources and influences. Some are deeply 
    engrained in us by our media consumption; others emerge from our lived 
    experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Ai Jen Poo and Eldar Shafir argue in an “Ideas Brief” from the U.S. 
    Partnership on Mobility, some of the strongest held narratives in the U.S. 
    are those about poverty. Many of them lead to misunderstandings about 
    poverty and its causes, and result in misguided social policy, such as work 
    requirements for benefits. Even professionals who do anti-poverty work are 
    not immune to these narratives. In fact, many people closest to the problem 
    of poverty—such as public servants and human service providers—bring their 
    own narratives and cognitive biases to their work, including fundamental 
    attribution error and implicit bias. The false “culture of poverty” 
    narrative is also pervasive in various spheres of American life— the belief 
    that poverty is driven by individual fault, not circumstances outside of a 
    person’s control. Evidence from the field of behavioral science and research 
    on the cognitive effects of scarcity paint a different picture: poverty is a 
    context that has deleterious effects on people. To tackle poverty, we must 
    design for the context of poverty.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why focus on narratives? Narratives are powerful. They drive public 
    imagination and attitudes towards people who live in poverty. Because 
    narratives are a lens through which we view and judge the world, narratives 
    also shape how we interact with the world: what positions we take on policy, 
    how we vote, and how we treat other people in our communities. False 
    narratives are also harmful. Policy and programs are less effective at 
    addressing poverty when they are based on false narratives. But this also 
    presents an opportunity: changing false poverty narratives has the potential 
    to shift support for effective social policies and programs that actually 
    address poverty’s root causes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many types of organizations and disciplines are working to shift harmful 
    narratives about poverty. With a deep understanding of human behavior and an 
    experimental toolkit, behavioral science as a field is uniquely positioned 
    to design new innovation approaches to narrative change. Our narrative 
    change work aims to partner with community-based organizations in three U.S. 
    cities to shift local narratives through behaviorally informed designs. We 
    also seek to create tools to help measure the success of our narrative 
    change efforts and potentially others, helping to advance the narrative 
    change field. Centering the voices of people who live in these communities, 
    our ultimate goal will be to ensure that policies and practices that aim to 
    address poverty are based on science and the lived experience of people 
    living in poverty, and not harmful false narratives.
  </p>

  <h2>Mission/vision</h2>
  <p>
    Our narrative change work aims to collaborate with local communities to 
    reimagine narratives about poverty and instill those narratives into 
    effective social policy and program design.
  </p>
  <p>
    We envision a U.S. where a shared, evidence-based narrative of poverty 
    removes inequities that prevent all people from leading fulfilled lives of 
    their own definition.
  </p>

  <h2>How will we do this?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Measure narrative change.</strong> We will partner closely with 
    academics and narrative change experts to define the ways narrative change 
    is measured, including appropriate metrics and frequency of measurement. 
    Approaches may include quantitative methods, such as survey data, as well as 
    qualitative methods, such as focus groups with community members. As 
    necessary, we will create novel measurement tools, and may collect baseline 
    data to effectively track our progress as we execute narrative change 
    strategies.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cultivate deep community partnerships.</strong> We recognize that we cannot do 
    narrative change work alone, and we will need engage with our target 
    communities in a deeper fashion. We will partner with community-based 
    organizations in New York City, Washington D.C., and San Francisco. Building 
    local partnerships will allow us to work more efficiently and effectively 
    by leveraging the tacit knowledge embedded in communities.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Uncover narratives and pathways to change.</strong> Working closely with community 
    members, we will unearth narratives that influence attitudes and beliefs 
    about social policy. We aim to understand:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What are current community narratives about poverty?
    </li>
    <li>
      What are the existing community assets? Who are the potential messengers 
      of (e.g., community leaders or other influencers) and channels for 
      (e.g., radio, social media, etc.) narrative change?
    </li>
    <li>
      What may be existing barriers to change in narratives?
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Design and implement narrative change intervention(s).</strong> Building on the 
    data we gather, we will work closely with our academic and community 
    partners to design interventions tailored for each of our target cities 
    and the narratives we find in them. Interventions might include: social 
    media campaigns; deep canvassing; public art; film, video, or audio 
    narratives; etc. As we implement these interventions, we will monitor and 
    evaluate our success using the metrics identified earlier in the project. 
    Broadly, we hope to see residents’ perception of people living in poverty 
    shift to incorporate an understanding of the role of context, and for those 
    experiencing poverty to feel greater dignity in their communities and when 
    they interact with human service providers. Presuming that we achieve those 
    shifts, we’d also expect to see improving attitudes toward social welfare 
    programs and concomitant support for policy change. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Why behavioral science</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Using our experience in quantitative and qualitative research, we can 
      investigate how narratives about poverty come to exist and are shaped in 
      local and national contexts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using our proclivity for smart design and iteration, we can design 
      different narrative change solutions- replace deleterious narratives with 
      those informed by the concept of scarcity.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using our deep behavioral science knowledge and process, we can explore 
      the ways behavioral principles, including identity, availability bias, 
      framing, and confirmation bias, play a role in shaping, reinforcing, and 
      potentially shifting narratives.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using our experience running rigorous evaluations and defining and 
      measuring success, we can test diverse solutions to evaluate what works 
      and what doesn’t. We can play a role in defining what outcomes matter, 
      and which will lead to the behaviors we want to see to reduce poverty--better 
      policies, better program design, more informed residents.
    </li>
  </ul>
