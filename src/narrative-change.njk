      Human beings are processing enormous amounts of information at any one time, 
      and invariably, can’t make sense of all of it. To get by, we use heuristics 
      (e.g., rule of thumbs) and narratives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Narrative can be defined as ”a collection or system of related stories that 
      are articulated and refined over time to represent a central idea or belief.” 
      Narratives come from innumerable sources and influences. Some are deeply 
      ingrained in us by our media consumption; others emerge from our lived 
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Ai Jen Poo and Eldar Shafir <a href="https://www.mobilitypartnership.org/changing-narrative">argue in an “Ideas Brief” from the U.S. 
      Partnership on Mobility</a>, some of the strongest held narratives in the U.S. 
      are those about poverty. Many of them lead to misunderstandings about 
      poverty and its causes, and result in misguided social policy, such as <a href="http://www.ideas42.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ideas42-Work-Requirements-Paper.pdf">work 
      requirements for benefits</a>. Even professionals who do anti-poverty work are 
      not immune to these narratives. In fact, many people closest to the problem 
      of poverty—such as public servants and human service providers—bring their 
      own narratives and cognitive biases to their work, including fundamental 
      attribution error and implicit bias. The false “culture of poverty” 
      narrative is also pervasive in various spheres of American life— the belief 
      that poverty is driven by individual fault, not circumstances outside of a 
      person’s control. Evidence from the field of behavioral science and <a href="http://www.ideas42.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/I42_PovertyWhitePaper_Digital_FINAL-1.pdf">research 
      on the cognitive effects of scarcity</a> paint a different picture: poverty is a 
      context that has deleterious effects on people. To tackle poverty, we must 
      design for the context of poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why focus on narratives? Narratives are powerful. They drive public 
      imagination and attitudes towards people who live in poverty. Because 
      narratives are a lens through which we view and judge the world, narratives 
      also shape how we interact with the world: what positions we take on policy, 
      how we vote, and how we treat other people in our communities. False 
      narratives are also harmful. Policy and programs are less effective at 
      addressing poverty when they are based on false narratives. But this also 
      presents an opportunity: changing false poverty narratives has the potential 
      to shift support for effective social policies and programs that actually 
      address poverty’s root causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many types of organizations and disciplines are working to shift harmful 
      narratives about poverty. With a deep understanding of human behavior and an 
      experimental toolkit, behavioral science as a field is uniquely positioned 
      to design new innovation approaches to narrative change. Our narrative 
      change work aims to partner with community-based organizations in three U.S. 
      cities to shift local narratives through behaviorally informed designs. We 
      also seek to create tools to help measure the success of our narrative 
      change efforts and potentially others, helping to advance the narrative 
      change field. Centering the voices of people who live in these communities, 
      our ultimate goal will be to ensure that policies and practices that aim to 
      address poverty are based on science and the lived experience of people 
      living in poverty, and not harmful false narratives.
    </p>

    <h2>Mission/vision</h2>
    <p>
      Our narrative change work aims to collaborate with local communities to 
      reimagine narratives about poverty and instill those narratives into 
      effective social policy and program design.
    </p>
    <p>
      We envision a U.S. where a shared, evidence-based narrative of poverty 
      removes inequities that prevent all people from leading fulfilled lives of 
      their own definition.
    </p>

    <h2>How will we do this?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Measure narrative change.</strong> We will partner closely with 
      academics and narrative change experts to define the ways narrative change 
      is measured, including appropriate metrics and frequency of measurement. 
      Approaches may include quantitative methods, such as survey data, as well as 
      qualitative methods, such as focus groups with community members, and the creation of novel tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cultivate deep community partnerships.</strong> We recognize that we cannot do 
      narrative change work alone, and we will need to engage with our target 
      communities more deeply. We will partner with community-based 
      organizations in New York City, Washington D.C., and San Francisco to 
      leverage the tacit knowledge embedded in communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Uncover narratives and pathways to change.</strong> Working closely with community 
      members, we will unearth narratives that influence attitudes and beliefs 
      about social policy. We aim to understand:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What are current community narratives about poverty?
      </li>
      <li>
        What are the existing community assets? Who are the potential messengers 
        of (e.g., community leaders or other influencers) and channels for 
        (e.g., radio, social media, etc.) narrative change?
      </li>
      <li>
        What may be existing barriers to change in narratives?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Design and implement narrative change intervention(s).</strong> Building on the 
      data we gather, we will work closely with our academic and community 
      partners to design interventions tailored for each of our target cities 
      and the narratives we find in them. Interventions might include: social 
      media campaigns; deep canvassing; public art; film, video, or audio 
      narratives; etc. As we implement these interventions, we will monitor and 
      evaluate our success using the metrics identified earlier in the project. 
      Broadly, we hope to see residents’ perception of people living in poverty 
      shift to incorporate an understanding of the role of context, and for those 
      experiencing poverty to feel greater dignity in their communities and when 
      they interact with human service providers. Presuming that we achieve those 
      shifts, we’d also expect to see improving attitudes toward social welfare 
      programs and concomitant support for policy change. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why behavioral science</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Using our experience in quantitative and qualitative research, we can 
        investigate how narratives about poverty come to exist and are shaped in 
        local and national contexts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using our proclivity for smart design and iteration, we can design 
        different narrative change solutions- replace deleterious narratives with 
        those informed by the concept of scarcity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using our deep behavioral science knowledge and process, we can explore 
        the ways behavioral principles, including identity, availability bias, 
        framing, and confirmation bias, play a role in shaping, reinforcing, and 
        potentially shifting narratives.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using our experience running rigorous evaluations and defining and 
        measuring success, we can test diverse solutions to evaluate what works 
        and what doesn’t. We can play a role in defining what outcomes matter, 
        and which will lead to the behaviors we want to see to reduce poverty--better 
        policies, better program design, more informed residents.
